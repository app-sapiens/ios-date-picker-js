# ios-date-picker-js
Cross platform reanimated implementation of iOS date picker

[![runs with expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Runs%20with%20Expo-000.svg?style=flat-square&logo=EXPO&labelColor=f3f3f3&logoColor=000)](https://expo.io/)

There has been a notable abscence of good JS-only date time pickers for React Native.

When [@wcandillion](https://github.com/wcandillon) created his Picker video I felt obliged to create this repo.

Help needed to make this a useable library!
